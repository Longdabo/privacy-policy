<p>Privacy Policy</p>

<p>Serenity Sleep: White Noise &amp; Calm <br>Last Updated: December 5, 2025</p>

<p>We take your privacy very seriously. This policy clearly explains exactly what we collect, why we collect it, and how we use it.</p>

<p>1. Data We Collect (Very Limited, Mostly Anonymous)</p>

<p>(1) Data You Actively Provide <br>→ None at all. <br>The app requires no registration, no login, no email, and no personal information whatsoever.</p>

<p>(2) Automatically Collected Anonymous Analytics Data (Firebase Analytics) <br>We only use Google Firebase Analytics to help us understand overall app usage (e.g., which white noise sounds are most popular, crash rates) so we can improve the product. <br>Specifically collected items include: <br>- Device type, OS version, device language, country/region (country-level only) <br>- In-app events: opening the app, playing certain sounds, completing breathing exercises, using timers, etc. (all completely anonymous and never linked to any personal identity) <br>- Crash reports (only when the app crashes) <br> <br>All of this data is fully anonymous and cannot identify you as an individual. <br>Firebase Privacy Policy: https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</p>

<p>(3) Advertising-Related Data (Google AdMob) <br>The free version contains non-intrusive ads (banner + interstitial only; no video ads or pop-ups). <br>Ads are served by Google AdMob, which collects: <br>- Advertising ID (a resettable random identifier) <br>- Approximate location (country/city level only, used to serve more relevant ads) <br>- Device information (used for ad frequency capping) <br> <br>Personalized ads are enabled by default. You can turn them off at any time: <br>→ Android: Settings → Google → Ads → Turn off “Personalized ads” or “Reset advertising ID” <br>→ iOS: Settings → Privacy &amp; Security → Apple Advertising → Turn on “Limit Ad Tracking” or “Reset Advertising Identifier”</p>

<p>AdMob Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy</p>

<p>2. Locally Stored Data (Saved Only on Your Device)<br>- Your favorite tracks, custom mixes, breathing exercise preferences, timer settings, and downloaded content <br>This data never leaves your phone and is never uploaded to any server. Uninstalling the app deletes everything permanently.</p>

<p>3. Information We Never Collect<br>- Name, email, phone number, precise location, contacts, photos, microphone, camera — we request none of these permissions <br>- No other third-party analytics tools (only Firebase) <br>- We never sell or share any of your data with third parties (except anonymized advertising ID for ads)<br> <br>4. Children&#39;s Privacy<br>The app is suitable for all ages, including children under 13. <br>Since we only collect anonymous analytics data and resettable advertising IDs, we fully comply with COPPA, GDPR-K, and other children&#39;s privacy regulations.</p>

<p>5. Your Rights &amp; Choices<br>- Delete the app at any time → all data is immediately and permanently deleted <br>- Reset advertising ID or disable personalized ads (see instructions above) <br>- If you want to export or delete your Firebase anonymous data, just email us and we will help submit the request to Google<br> <br>6. Policy Changes<br>If we make any significant changes, we will prominently notify you with a popup on app launch and in the update notes. The new policy takes effect immediately upon publication.</p>

<p>7. Contact Us<br>For any privacy questions, email us anytime: <br>longdabo@gmail.com <br>We reply within 24 hours.</p>

<p>Thank you for choosing Serenity Sleep. We promise to collect only the minimum data necessary to improve the app and keep the free version running — so you can sleep peacefully, and so can we.</p>
