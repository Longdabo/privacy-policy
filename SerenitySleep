Serenity Sleep: White Noise & Calm  
Last Updated: December 5, 2025

We take your privacy very seriously. This policy clearly explains exactly what we collect, why we collect it, and how we use it.

1. Data We Collect (Very Limited, Mostly Anonymous)

(1) Data You Actively Provide  
→ None at all.  
The app requires no registration, no login, no email, and no personal information whatsoever.

(2) Automatically Collected Anonymous Analytics Data (Firebase Analytics)  
We only use Google Firebase Analytics to help us understand overall app usage (e.g., which white noise sounds are most popular, crash rates) so we can improve the product.  
Specifically collected items include:  
- Device type, OS version, device language, country/region (country-level only)  
- In-app events: opening the app, playing certain sounds, completing breathing exercises, using timers, etc. (all completely anonymous and never linked to any personal identity)  
- Crash reports (only when the app crashes)  
  
All of this data is fully anonymous and cannot identify you as an individual.  
Firebase Privacy Policy: https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy

(3) Advertising-Related Data (Google AdMob)  
The free version contains non-intrusive ads (banner + interstitial only; no video ads or pop-ups).  
Ads are served by Google AdMob, which collects:  
- Advertising ID (a resettable random identifier)  
- Approximate location (country/city level only, used to serve more relevant ads)  
- Device information (used for ad frequency capping)  
  
Personalized ads are enabled by default. You can turn them off at any time:  
→ Android: Settings → Google → Ads → Turn off “Personalized ads” or “Reset advertising ID”  
→ iOS: Settings → Privacy & Security → Apple Advertising → Turn on “Limit Ad Tracking” or “Reset Advertising Identifier”

AdMob Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

2. Locally Stored Data (Saved Only on Your Device)
- Your favorite tracks, custom mixes, breathing exercise preferences, timer settings, and downloaded content  
This data never leaves your phone and is never uploaded to any server. Uninstalling the app deletes everything permanently.

3. Information We Never Collect
- Name, email, phone number, precise location, contacts, photos, microphone, camera — we request none of these permissions  
- No other third-party analytics tools (only Firebase)  
- We never sell or share any of your data with third parties (except anonymized advertising ID for ads)
  
4. Children's Privacy
The app is suitable for all ages, including children under 13.  
Since we only collect anonymous analytics data and resettable advertising IDs, we fully comply with COPPA, GDPR-K, and other children's privacy regulations.

5. Your Rights & Choices
- Delete the app at any time → all data is immediately and permanently deleted  
- Reset advertising ID or disable personalized ads (see instructions above)  
- If you want to export or delete your Firebase anonymous data, just email us and we will help submit the request to Google
  
6. Policy Changes
If we make any significant changes, we will prominently notify you with a popup on app launch and in the update notes. The new policy takes effect immediately upon publication.

7. Contact Us
For any privacy questions, email us anytime:  
longdabo@gmail.com  
We reply within 24 hours.

Thank you for choosing Serenity Sleep. We promise to collect only the minimum data necessary to improve the app and keep the free version running — so you can sleep peacefully, and so can we.
